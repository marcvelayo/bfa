<h2> ARTIST STATEMENT: </h2>
  
<center>
<center>Hello, my name is Marc Velayo. I am an aspiring artist who ventures in different kinds of art medium-- both traditional and digital. Through creating art, I’ve 
<center>learned how to express my emotions-- my dreams, fears and thoughts. It has instilled courage and confidence in me to fearlessly depict my true self.
<p>
<center>My work represents who I was in the past, what I feel in the present and who I want to be in the future. I am a proud immigrant-- born and raised in Antipolo, 
<center>Philippines. I was first introduced to using computers when I was 10. I remember playing around our Dell computer-- opening programs such as Paint and Adobe 
<center>Photoshop Elements. Who knew I’d be using these programs now to further my passion and career in art? I was just a kid playing and messing around, fascinated 
<center>by the vivid colors and simple strokes I was creating. 
<p>
<center>My work depicts the emotions I’ve felt and feel, and the vivid memories I’ve experienced and currently experiencing. I use my recollections as a strength and guide
<center>in telling my story, to add a personal touch in every medium that I use. I am highly interested in innovation-- especially in the field of Technology. Being able 
<center>to take classes under Digital Media has opened my eyes to all the amazing possibilities of what technology and art can do. Technology and art together can create 
<center>powerful, highly engaging pieces and that’s what I want to pursue. My ambition in being a part of the BFA program is to learn more, create more and be heavily 
<center>immersed in the world of technology based art and concepts. I want to be a part of an amazing and talented community, where artists thrive in a space powered by 
<center>their knowledge in intersecting art and technology for expression. 
<p>
<center>I passionately want to use my voice and story to create pieces that can impact and influence our society. As a student, I’ve learned various programs to help me 
<center>further my knowledge in digital media such as the Adobe Creative Softwares, 3D Modeling software like Blender, languages such as HTML, CSS etc. I want to further 
<center>my journey as a Digital Media student, and gain more important lessons that I can use in my career and that can guide me in life.
