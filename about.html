<h2> ARTIST STATEMENT: </h2>
  
<div>
  <p>
Hello, my name is Marc Velayo. I am an aspiring artist who ventures in different kinds of art medium-- both traditional and digital.Through creating art, I have learned how to express my emotions-- my dreams, fears and thoughts. It has instilled courage and confidence in me to fearlessly depict my true self. Art has given me the opportunity to be myself in a world full of judgement and has continuously provided me with a huge room to dream and scream.
<p>
My work represents who I was in the past, what I feel in the present and who I want to be in the future. I am a proud immigrant-- born and raised in Antipolo, Philippines. I was first introduced to the world of computers when I was 10 years old. I remember playing using our Dell computer-- opening various programs such as Paint and Adobe Photoshop Elements. Who knew I’d be using these programs now to further my passion and career in art? I was just a kid playing and messing around, fascinated by the vivid colors and simple strokes I was creating.
<p>
My work depicts the emotions I’ve felt and the vivid memories I’ve experienced. From feeling calm and peaceful, to being in a state of rage-- art has truly provided me a space to vent out. I use my recollections as my strength and guide in telling my story-- to add a personal touch and message in every medium that I use. I am highly interested in innovation-- especially in the field of Technology. Being able to take classes under Digital Media has opened my eyes to all the amazing possibilities and opportunities of what technology and art can do. Technology and art together can create powerful, highly engaging pieces and that’s what I want to pursue for my career. My early work within the first few DMA classes I took (including Art 74 and 75) dives into various concepts that I was highly interested in such as the effects of technology and my culture. My ambition in being a part of the BFA program is to learn more, create more and be heavily immersed in the world of technology based art and concepts. I want to be a part of an amazing and talented community, where artists thrive in a space powered by their knowledge in intersecting art and technology for expression. 
<p>
I passionately want to use my voice and story to create pieces that can impact our society. I want to be able to influence people through my art and send out messages that can start connections and engagements. As a student, I have learned various programs to help me further my knowledge in digital media such as the Adobe Creative Softwares, 3D Modeling software (like Blender, Maya), creative coding, languages such as HTML, CSS etc. I want to further my journey as a Digital Media student and gain more important lessons that I can use in my career and that can guide me in life.
