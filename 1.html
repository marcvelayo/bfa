<h2> WHAT IF THANOS WASN'T EVIL?</h2>
<h3> Net Art, 2019. (Art 74) </h3>
</font>

<font face="monospace">

I&#39;ve always believed that there is always something good hidden in every situation, place, person or just anything in life. 
<center>
As human beings, we often encounter different things that brings us down, whether it&#39;s physically, spiritually or mentally.
I believe that during these worst, painful times-- that&#39;s when we best see the light. The shining light that 
could brighten up the pathways that we human beings need to walk on. This light enables us to constantly change,
constantly move on to heights that could help us be better people. One of my projects from Art 74-- <b>What If 
Thanos Wasn&#39;t Evil?</b>, depicts Thanos, one of the most hated villains of all time, in a different light. 
Thanos, an evil creature from the fictional, comic universe of The Avengers, wanted to collect all the infinity
stones to diminish half the universe. Through this work, I was able to create the opposite outcome he wanted. 
I created an opposite character who wanted to diminish all the destruction that happens in our world. 
Art is a very powerful weapon, that could create and change perception. It&#39;s a strong weapon that could be used
to alter emotions and explore new ideals. I hope that this project creates a new perspective-- thateven the biggest, meanest guy could somewhat change for the better.
